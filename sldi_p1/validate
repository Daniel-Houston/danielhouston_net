# usage: validate <account-db> <username> <password>

# This program will validate a user's login against
# a salted, hashed password database.

# An example account-db is provided in ../data/accounts.db

# The format of an account database is:

# <username>:<salt>:<salted-hashed-shasum-password>

# Given a password PASS and a salt SALT, the command-line
# utility shasum can compute its salted hash:

# $ echo -n PASS:SALT | shasum

# For instance, the password "foobar" with salt "500" yields:

# $ echo -n foobar:500 | shasum 
# 8a8cafed972dff26d81e4b9542334a303f3821e2  -

# Thus, if user "matt" had the password "foobar", there would
# be this line in the accounts database:

# matt:500:8a8cafed972dff26d81e4b9542334a303f3821e2

# Salted, hashed passwords are a way of storing a password so
# that authentication is possible, but the password is unknown
# even to the server itself.

# If the login is valid, the script should print "valid" and
# exit with status 0.

# If the login is not valid, the script should print "invalid"
# and exit with status 1.

# You can assume that there will only be one entry for a given username.

# WARNING: In practice, you need to use something stronger than shasum these
# days, but some salting and hashing is better than none at all.


# Usage:
if [[ ! -n "$3" ]]
then
	echo "usage `basename $0` <account-db> <username> <password>"
fi

# Get the username and some needed variables.
username="$2"
salt=$(cat "$1" | grep "$2" | awk -F ':' '{print $2}')
hash=$(cat "$1" | grep "$2" | awk -F ':' '{print $3}')
password="$3"

# Now check the shasum of the password they gave you and the salt you found. 
tempHash=$(printf "%s" "$password:$salt" | shasum | awk '{print $1}')

# If the hashes are the same, then it is valid, otherwise it isn't
if [[ "$tempHash" == "$hash" ]]
then
  echo "valid"
  exit 0
else
  echo "invalid"
  exit 1
fi
