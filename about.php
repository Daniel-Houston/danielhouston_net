                <p>I grew up in Kaysville, Utah, about 30 minutes north of Salt Lake City. When I turned 19 I moved to South Africa for two years to be a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. When I returned in 2012 I moved up to Salt Lake City to attend the University of Utah. I have been living there ever since. </p>
                <p>I am a sophomore in the Computer Science program at the University of Utah. The classes I am currently enrolled in are Discrete Structures (CS 2100), Software Practice 2 (CS 3505), and Scripting Language Design (CS 5961). I plan on graduating in the Fall of 2016.</p>
                <p>My career goals are to graduate with my bachelor's degree in computer science and work in the educational technology industry for 10 or 15 years. After that I would like to return to school to get my PhD in order to teach at a university and do research.</p>
                <p>My biggest hobby is music. I have been playing the piano since 1998 and love it. My current focus is jazz piano, but I love playing classical piano as well. </p>
